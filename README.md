# ResturantQA

The question answering (QA) task is an important research issue in natural language processing, which has gained significant attention over the past few years. With the development of e-commerce, a lot of shopping sites provide community question answering systems, where there are many product-related questions asked by customers on the product pages. Inspired by our recent experience with browsing Yelp reviews for local restaurants, observing that this feature has not been widely supported in other domains such as trip advisor, movies, and restaurants, we would like to explore models that are suitable for building a review-based QA system in restaurants domain, since many questions can be answered based on the available restaurant reviews. More specifically, we are interested in investigating and comparing five state-of-the-art QA models, namely T5, RoBERTa, XLNet, MoQA and BigBird. They have been proven to be the most effective models on some different QA datasets such as SQuAD and Quora question pairs. 
The models were evaluated over SubjQA dataset under restaurant domain, based on classic evaluation metrics, exact match (EM), and F1 score. The overall scores were computed for a model by averaging over the individual example scores. Our experiments affirmed that the best-performing approach on subjective restaurant reviews are the T5 model, with an exact match of 53.22 and f1 score of 58.54.
